To effectively encourage open communication and foster active listening within the workplace, organizations can implement the following strategies:

Teach employees to listen with full attention, maintain eye contact, paraphrase for clarity, and ask follow-up questions. Active listening builds trust and demonstrates respect for others' viewpoints.
